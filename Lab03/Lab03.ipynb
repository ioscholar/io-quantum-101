    "Suppose our input consists of $3$ bits, which gives us a total of $8$ possible input cases. In the classical approach, we must call the function $2^{3-1}+1 = 5$ times to determine whether it is constant or balanced. Imagine that for the first $4$ function calls, we supply different input bits and obtain the output bits shown in the table below. \n",
